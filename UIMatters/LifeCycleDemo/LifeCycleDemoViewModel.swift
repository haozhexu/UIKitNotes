        Some scholars believe that: "Shan Hai Jing" is China's first geography. "Shan Hai Jing" is not a purely geographical book, however, the geographical knowledge is in the top position. It orderly describes the geographical features by location, including nature geography and culture geography. First, "Shan Hai Jing" has a natural geographical description. This includes the record of many mountains, such as "the mountain of the court", "mountain of niuyang", "blue hill mountain", "Kei tail mountain" and so on, and each mountain is named according to the mountain landscape, these mountains also reflect the direction of the mountain; as well as an extremely rich hydrological record and rivers are mostly marked with the source. The beginning of the river can be in some foothills, and its injection is far away from this mountain. The narrator also noticed the full picture of the river streams. Despite the river routes were not recorded, but their approximate flow through region can be known through the route of tributaries to the mainstream such as Huanghe and Weishui. Secondly, it also recorded the human geography. For example, in the "sea" section, it records lots of regional social and cultural customs, economic development, scientific and technological achievements at that moment.
